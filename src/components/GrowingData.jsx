            GROWING YEARS PROGRAMME (The Middle School) is structured to meet children's varied intellectual and developmental needs. The MSP builds on concepts and skills learnt in the Primary School and ensures progression and continuity across various stages of learning in the School, and incorporates continuous evaluation and review of children's performance.
The main aims of the Programme are developing skills related to writing, reading, reflecting, critical thinking, public speaking, fostering initiative among students and a desire to acquire knowledge.
Art, Drama, Computer studies, Music, Yoga and Dance are integrated into the mainstream curriculum and are further strengthened as optional co curricular activities.
Personal, Social, Health Education helps students address their age-specific interests and concerns, builds awareness, and promotes compassionate and ethical conduct. Physical Education is offered in a more formal manner and sports skills are fine-tuned. This prepares students to pursue sports in a more structured and purposeful manner, including studying sports in the Secondary School as a formal subject.
